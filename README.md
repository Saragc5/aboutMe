# aboutMe

Hi there!

My name is Sara and I just turned my professional career around studying web development. 

Technologies have always interested me and one of the decisive steps to change the sector has been, above all, the fact of being able to build things that help solve everyday problems.

I am currently finishing the Codespace Academy Full Stack Bootcamp, of which I want to highlight my interest in the Frontend part, using React.
